      <h1>Creating a Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
    My first portfolio was a basic static site built with plain HTML, showcasing minimal functionality and design. The portfolio was never finished in its entirety, due to lack of practice and completed projects.

    <p>Visit my first portfolio <a href="https://hmj11001.github.io/hmj11001-original/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    In contrast, my new portfolio demonstrates significant growth in my development skills. 
    Starting with an HTML5 design template, I converted the entire project into a modular React application, integrating features like reusable components, dynamic 
    routing, and enhanced interactivity. This project not only highlights my technical skills but also demonstrates how Iâ€™ve 
    evolved as a developer, turning a static site into a polished, engaging web experience.
