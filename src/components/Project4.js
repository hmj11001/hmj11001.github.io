      <h1>Classic Blog</h1>
     <p> This blog is a simple Next.js project that highlights the simplicity of the framework. It uses static site generation 
        to pre-render pages, making the blog load quickly and perform better for SEO. The posts have their own unique URLs thanks to dynamic routing, 
        which makes everything feel more personalized. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Even though the blog is basic, itâ€™s a great example of how Next.js helps you build fast, easy-to-use websites with little setup. 
        The mix of static generation and dynamic routing results in a smooth, fast experience for anyone visiting the site.
